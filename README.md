# Water-monitor
In this work, we used the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev 2 to measure water temperatures at depths of 1m, 2m, and 3m. Data were collected and stored with GPS coordinates to analyze environmental conditions. The system’s effectiveness was validated through consistent results, making it a viable tool for environmental monitoring
